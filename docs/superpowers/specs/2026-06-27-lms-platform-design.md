## Intern Lifecycle

| State | Description |
|-------|------------|
| **Invited** | Mentor creates account, welcome email sent with login credentials |
| **Onboarding** | First login → password change → profile setup → starter content auto-assigned |
| **Active** | In-program, full access to unlocked content |
| **Paused** | Temporarily inactive (illness, leave) — mentor pauses, progress preserved |
| **Completed** | Finished program — account becomes read-only, can view own data |
| **Converted** | Offered full-time — flagged in system |
| **Removed** | Dropped from program — account deactivated, data archived |

---

## Features

### 1. Authentication & Accounts

- Email + password login
- No public signup — mentor creates intern accounts, admin creates mentor accounts
- JWT access tokens (15 min expiry) + refresh tokens (7 day expiry)
- Password reset via email
- Password requirements: min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number
- Force password change on first login
- Session management (single or multi-device configurable)
- Role-based access control (admin > mentor > intern)
- Account deactivation (soft delete, data preserved)
- Rate limiting on login: 5 attempts per 15 minutes

### 2. Course & Content Management

- Hierarchy: Courses → Modules → Lessons
- Content types:
  - Video (with resume — remember playback position per intern)
  - Text / Markdown
  - PDF (viewable + downloadable)
  - Code snippets (syntax highlighted)
  - Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb — rendered in-browser with outputs: charts, tables, markdown cells)
- Estimated duration per lesson and module
- Resource library (shared links, docs, tools across all courses)
- Version history on content edits (last 10 versions)
- Course categories/tags mapped to Tools & Technologies list

### 5. Daily Workflow

- **Attendance**:
  - Intern marks attendance daily within window: 9:30 AM – 10:30 AM
  - Late marking (10:30 AM – 11:00 AM) = marked as "Late"
  - After 11:00 AM = cannot mark, auto-absent unless mentor overrides
  - Once marked present, must complete all daily assigned tasks by 5:00 PM — otherwise status changes to "Incomplete"
  - Mentor can manually override attendance (mark present/absent/excused)
  - Weekend (Saturday) has separate attendance for learning day
- **Daily standup log**: What did yesterday, doing today, blockers
- **Daily task assignments**: Mentor assigns tasks with due time, intern checks off completion
